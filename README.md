# Julia Subtle Bug: Zero Input Handling

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to handling zero input in a Julia function. The function `myfunction` is designed to square positive inputs and negate negative inputs. However, it contains a subtle flaw in how it handles zero.

## Bug Description

The function incorrectly returns 0 when the input is 0. The expected behavior is to return 0 for zero input. This might seem insignificant but could lead to errors in larger programs that depend on consistent zero handling.

## Bug Reproduction

The `bug.jl` file contains the buggy function. Run the script to observe the incorrect output for zero input.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.jl` file provides a corrected version of the function, addressing the zero input handling issue.

## Additional Notes

This example highlights how seemingly small details can introduce unexpected behavior in programs. Thorough testing and careful consideration of edge cases, such as zero input, are crucial for writing robust and reliable code.
